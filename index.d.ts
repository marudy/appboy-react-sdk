/**
 * When launching an iOS application that has previously been force closed, React Native's Linking API doesn't
 * support handling deep links embedded in push notifications. This is due to a race condition on startup between
 * the native call to RCTLinkingManager and React's loading of its JavaScript. This function provides a workaround:
 * If an application is launched from a push notification click, we return any Appboy deep links in the push payload.
 * @param {function(string)} callback - A callback that retuns the deep link as a string. If there is no deep link,
 * returns null.

/**
 * When a user first uses Appboy on a device they are considered "anonymous". Use this method to identify a user
 *    with a unique ID, which enables the following:
 *
 *    - If the same user is identified on another device, their user profile, usage history and event history will
 *        be shared across devices.
 *    - If your app is used on the same device by multiple people, you can assign each of them a unique identifier
 *        to track them separately. Only the most recent user on a particular browser will receive push
 *        notifications and in-app messages.
 *
 * When you request a user switch (which is any call to changeUser where the new user ID is not the same as the
 *    existing user ID), the current session for the previous user (anonymous or not) is automatically ended and
 *    a new session is started. Similarly, following a call to changeUser, any events which fire are guaranteed to
 *    be for the new user -- if an in-flight server request completes for the old user after the user switch no
 *    events will fire, so you do not need to worry about filtering out events from Appboy for old users.
 *
 * Additionally, if you identify a user which has never been identified on another device, the entire history of
 *    that user as an "anonymous" user on this device will be preserved and associated with the newly identified
 *    user. However, if you identify a user which *has* been identified in another app, any history which was
 *    already flushed to the server for the anonymous user on this device will become orphaned and will not be
 *    associated with any future users. These orphaned users are not considered in your user counts and will not
 *    be messaged.
 *
 * Note: Once you identify a user, you cannot revert to the "anonymous" user. The transition from anonymous to
 *    identified tracking is only allowed once because the initial anonymous user receives special treatment to
 *    allow for preservation of their history. As a result, we recommend against changing the user ID just because
 *    your app has entered a "logged out" state because it makes you unable to target the previously logged out user
 *    with re-engagement campaigns. If you anticipate multiple users on the same device, but only want to target one
 *    of them when your app is in a logged out state, we recommend separately keeping track of the user ID you want
 *    to target while logged out and switching back to that user ID as part of your app's logout process.
